    This app allows you to include any YouTube video in your PowerPoint presentation.
</p>
<p>
    To use this app, you must first find the video that you want to include: go to <a href="http://www.youtube.com">www.youtube.com</a> and browse for the video you want. Then look in the address bar to get the URL. 
</p>
<p>
    Copy that URL and paste it into this app <a href="../pages/home.html">on the main page</a>. Then click the Set Video button to save that ID and view the video. Afterwards, when you send the presentation to other people or open it yourself, it will already have your chosen video ready to play.
</p>
<p>
    If you want another video, insert another Web Video Player app from the Insert Apps for Office button in the ribbon.
</p>
<p>
    YouTube does not allow video-embedding within PowerPoint Online, so there the viewer will have to click to see the video in a new window.
