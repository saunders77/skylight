    <h1>Web Video Player for PowerPoint</h1>
        <p>
            Web Video Player for PowerPoint lets you insert YouTube and Vimeo videos into your presentations.
            You can get the add-in free from the <a href="https://store.office.com/en-us/app.aspx?assetid=WA104221182">Web Video Player page on the Office Store</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The add-in works in Microsoft Powerpoint 2016 for Mac and PC, PowerPoint 2013, PowerPoint Online, and PowerPoint for iPad.
            It also works in those versions of Excel.
            Using it is simple: for each video you want, insert Web Video Player, enter the video URL, and click Set Video.
        </p>
        <p>
            The user base is growing (around 60,000 monthly user sessions as of August 2017), but I still only get 20 to 30 requests/bugs/feedback messages per week, so each time you contact me it helps me improve the add-in.
            So go ahead and tell me about any problems or suggestions at <a href="mailto:webvideoplayer@outlook.com">webvideoplayer@outlook.com</a>.

            <p>
                On the Insert menu, the Add-ins button has a dropdown arrow to the right.
                If you've inserted one before, it will appear as an option on the dropdown.

        <h3><a id="urls">What kind of URL do I need to enter?</a></h3>
            <p>
                The easiest way to enter a video URL is simply to copy it from the address bar at <a href="www.youtube.com">YouTube</a> or <a href="www.vimeo.com/categories">Vimeo</a>.
                Here are examples of different URLs that are all supported and embed the same YouTube video:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ</b>: This is a YouTube video URL copied from the address bar in your browser.</li>
                    <li><b>https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ</b>: This is a YouTube Sharing URL copied from YouTube's Share feature.</li>
                    <li><b>https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ</b>: This is a YouTube embed code URL copied from YouTube's embed feature.</li>
                    <li><b>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ&list=RDQMdjpOzKFbGt8</b>: This is a YouTube video URL from a playlist copied from the address bar in your browser. In Web Video Player the playlist won't play - only the single video.</li>
                </ul>
                If you encounter some other YouTube URL format that doesn't work but you think Web Video Player should understand it, <a href="mailto:webvideoplayer@outlook.com">send me an email</a> and I'll try to add support for it.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Private</b> YouTube videos cannot be embedded. <b>Unlisted</b> ones can though.
                You can change the video privacy status for your own YouTube video in your Video Manager on YouTube.
            </p>
            <p>
                For Vimeo you must simply enter the URL from the address bar in your browser.
                It looks like this: <b>https://vimeo.com/22542169</b>
            </p>
        <h3><a id="delete">How do I delete a video?</a></h3>
            <p>
                To delete a video, first select it. Then press the delete button on your keyboard.
            </p>
            <p>
                The easiest way to select it is to click the edge of the video (left, right, top, or bottom).
                If you do it right, you should see eight small white "selection handles" appear at the corners and sides.
            </p>
        <h3><a id="replace">How do I switch or replace one video with another or edit the URL?</a></h3>
            <p>
                Delete the video (<a href="#delete">how to delete quickly</a>), then insert another one (<a href="#insertvideo">how to insert quickly</a>).
            </p>
        <h3><a id="2010">Can I use Web Video Player with PowerPoint 2010 or 2011 for Mac?</a></h3>
            <p>
                PowerPoint 2010 and 2011 for Mac do not support Web Video Player or any other web-based add-ins.
                If you're using Web Video Player with a presentation and then open that presentation in PowerPoint 2010 or 2011, you will still be able to use all the normal PowerPoint features, but the video will appear as a static image.
                Once you reopen the presentation in a supported (more-recent) version of PowerPoint, the video will play properly again.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you don't want to pay for an updated version of PowerPoint, you can use <a href="https://office.live.com/start/PowerPoint.aspx">PowerPoint Online with OneDrive</a> for free on Mac or PC.
                And it supports Web Video Player.
            </p>
        <h3><a id="soundonly">I get sound but not video</a></h3>
            <p>
                Some users have reported a bug on Mac OS Yosemite that causes the sound to play against a black or white screen, without video displayed.
                Apple has corrected this issue in Mac OS Sierra.
                You can upgrade for free (instructions: <a href="https://www.apple.com/macos/how-to-upgrade/">https://www.apple.com/macos/how-to-upgrade/</a>). 
            </p>
    <h2><a id="support">Support and feedback</a></h2>
        <p>
            If you have suggestions, requests for features you'd find useful, comments, bug reports, or you need help with something that isn't explained well above, please let me know at <a href="mailto:webvideoplayer@outlook.com">webvideoplayer@outlook.com</a>.

    <h2><a id="privacy">Privacy</a></h2>
        <p>
            The add-in <i>never</i> collects, stores, or transmits information that can be used to identify you, except for PayPal data: 
            If you use PayPal to contribute, then PayPal provides Web Video Player with the email address and name from your PayPal account.
        </p>
        <p>
            Google is used to track traffic, so they do collect metadata such as how many people use the add-in and how often, but not any personally-identifiable information.
        </p>
    <h2><a id="financial">Contributing with PayPal and getting premium features</a></h2>
        <p>
            Web Video Player is provided with basic video insertion and playing for free.
            It's funded via $5 voluntary contributions, which can be made through PayPal from the Mac or Windows versions of Office. 
            You must sign in to Office in the top right corner with a work, school, or personal account before purchasing.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once a user contributes, the add-in stores their Office account identifier in a database. 
            From then on, those users get access to premium features. 
            Those users also get a promise to never see adds in Web Video Player, now and in the future. 
            These premium features work no matter what computer, document, or operating system you use for Web Video Player. 
            The number of files enabled for the $5 contribution is <i>unlimited</i>. 
            The only requirement is that you sign in to Office.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here is the current list of premium features. All of these are awarded to users who contribute:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Autoplay</b> lets you configure the video to start playing when the add-in loads, without needing to click the Play button.
                    If you select this option, the video will automatically start playing when you go to the slide with the video (and, as usual, stop automatically when you leave the slide).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Custom Start Time</b> lets you configure the video to start at a specific time, other than 0:00.
                    If you select this option, the video will reset to the custom start time every time you leave and return to the slide.
                </li>
                <li><b>Custom End Time</b> lets you configure the video to end at a specific time (only supported for YouTube videos)</li>
            </ul>
            All of these features work after the video is inserted, even if another user who did not make a contribution is opening the file.
        </p>
        <p>
            Bulk licenses for are available at a discounted rate.
            The license can be applied to many users at an organization without the users needing to deal with payment for premium features individually.
            Contact me for details at <a href="mailto:webvideoplayer@outlook.com">webvideoplayer@outlook.com</a>.      
        </p>
        <p>
            As always, you can of course use Web Video Player completely free. And I promise to <i>never</i> make you pay for access to features you're already using.
