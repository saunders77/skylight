        This add-in allows you to include any YouTube or Vimeo video in your PowerPoint presentation or in Excel.

        Privacy information is available on the <a href="../pages/privacy.html">Privacy page</a>.

        To use this add-in, you must first find the video that you want to include: go to <a href="http://www.youtube.com">www.youtube.com</a> or <a href=http://vimeo.com/categories>www.vimeo.com</a> and browse for the video you want. Then look in the address bar to get the URL. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Copy that entire URL and paste it into this app in the white box <a href="../pages/home.html">on the main page</a>. Then click the Set Video button to save that choice and view the video. Afterwards, when you send the presentation to other people or open it yourself, it will already have your chosen video ready to play.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you want another video, insert another Web Video Player app from the Insert Add-ins button in the ribbon.
    </p>
    <p>
        An advertisement is displayed at the bottom of the configuration page and is served by Google. The advertisement disappears permanently once the video has been selected.
