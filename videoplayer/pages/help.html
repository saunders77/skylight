    <h3>Help</h3>
	<p>
        This add-in allows you to include any YouTube or Vimeo video in your PowerPoint presentation or in Excel.
    </p>
	<p>
        To use this add-in, you must first find the video that you want to include: go to <a onclick="window.open('https://www.youtube.com');"><u>www.youtube.com</u></a> or <a onclick="window.open('https://vimeo.com/categories');"><u>www.vimeo.com</u></a> and browse for the video you want. Then look in the address bar to get the URL. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Copy that entire URL and paste it into this app in the white box <a href="../pages/home.html">on the main page</a>. Then click the Set Video button to save that choice and view the video. Afterwards, when you send the presentation to other people or open it yourself, it will already have your chosen video ready to play.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you want another video, insert another Web Video Player app from the Insert Add-ins button in the ribbon.
    </p>
	<p>
        An advertisement may be displayed at the bottom of the configuration page and is served by Google. The advertisement disappears permanently once the video has been selected. 
    </p>
	<h3>Privacy</h3>
	<p>
        This add-in does collect or store any information except the video ID that you provide. That only gets saved in your document. No personal information gets sent anywhere online.
    </p>
	<p>
        Google is used to serve ads and track traffic, so they do collect metadata such as how many people use the add-in and how often.
